In Python/Java, we called them objects. Like a new data type that contains attributes (not concerned with methods) that we can change and access

(defstruct structureName attr1 attr2 ...)

Define it with all the arrributes you want your structure to have. Types are not defined, so you can assin anything to the atrtributes

List creates the constructor for you which is super convenient, and the accessors are also prettyr straightforward
